                        <b>Abstract: </b>Some recent services use a sequencer to simplify ordering operations on sharded data.
                        The sequencer assigns each operation a multi-sequence number which explicitly orders
                        the operation on each shard it accesses. Existing sequencers have two shortcomings. 
                        First, failures can result in some multi-sequence numbers never being assigned, exposing
                        a noncontiguous multi-sequence, which requires complex scaffolding to handle. 
                        Second, existing implementations use single-machine sequencers, limiting service 
                        throughput to the ordering throughput of one machine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We make two contributions. First, we posit that sequencers should expose our 
                        new contiguous multi-sequence abstraction. Contiguity guarantees every sequence 
                        number is assigned an operation, simplifying the abstraction. Second, we design 
                        and implement MASON, the first system to expose the contiguous multi-sequence 
                        abstraction and the first to provide a scalable multi-sequence. MASON is thus an 
                        ideal building block for consistent, scalable services. Our evaluation shows MASON 
                        unlocks scalable throughput for two strongly-consistent services built on it.

                    <!-- <p>My current research, with collaborator <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~theanos/">Theano Stavrinos</a>,
                        focuses on centralized sequencers in distributed systems. A centralized sequencer is a server
                        that hands out sequence numbers to clients in a distributed system, which use the sequence numbers to order their operations.
                        Multi-sequencing, a recent development, extends sequencers to allow consistent cross-shard transactions.
                        Multi-sequencing uses sequence spaces, logically independent sequences of strictly increasing integers, where, typically, each
                        sequence space is mapped to a shard.
                        Previous works' multi-sequencers provide a noncontiguous multi-sequence abstraction which can contain holes in the sequence &mdash; integers in the
                        sequence that are not used &mdash; introducing complexity for the service developer.
                        Our work focuses on providing a stronger abstraction, a contiguous multi-sequence, which assigns exactly one operation to every integer
                        in each increasing sequence space such that each sequence space has no holes.
                        The contiguous multi-sequence abstraction is easy for distributed service developers to reason about while being flexible
                        enough for developers to specialize execution of their operations for better performance. We implement the abstraction in a multi-sequencing
                        subsystem that is also the the first scalable multi-sequencer.</p> -->

                    <p><b>Abstract: </b>
                        Scalable storage systems where data is sharded across many machines are now 
                        the norm for Web services as their data has grown beyond what a single machine can 
                        handle. Consistently reading data across different shards requires transactional 
                        isolation for the reads. Yet a Web service may read from its data store hundreds or 
                        thousands of times for a single page load and must minimize read latency to keep 
                        response times low. Examining the read-only transaction algorithms for many recent 
                        academic and industrial scalable storage systems suggests there is a tradeoff 
                        between their power—expressed as the consistency they provide and their compatibility 
                        with other types of transactions—and their latency.
                    </p><p>
                    We show that this tradeoff is fundamental by proving the SNOW Theorem, 
                    an impossibility result that states that no read-only transaction algorithm can 
                    provide both the lowest latency and the highest power. We then use the tight 
                    boundary from the theorem to guide the design of new read-only transaction 
                    algorithms for two scalable storage systems, COPS and Rococo. We implement 
                    our new algorithms and then evaluate them to demonstrate they provide lower 
                    latency for read-only transactions and to understand their impact on overall throughput.
